Here is the rule of the game: The computer generates a number from 000000 to 999999, and you should guess the number.

Everytime, the computer will tell you the count of all i from 0..5 that guess[i]==target[i] (A). And the count of all (i,j) from (0..5,0..5) that guess[i]==target[j]&&i!=j (B).

If you find a bug, please contact me.
